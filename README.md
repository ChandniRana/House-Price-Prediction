 Predict the price of a house using Multiple Linear Regression


Housing price is affected by multiple factors and features of a specific house. According to the previous research, some analysts have proposed several variables that significantly influence the overall housing price. These factors can be classified into three types: house factors, environmental factors, and transportation factors. 

Analyzing data is for extracting accurate estimation from basic information provided. The most important and common question is whether there is a statistical relationship between an explanatory variable (usually denoted by Xi ) and a response variable (usually denoted by Yi). To solve this problem, a typical way is to apply regression analysis to model and quantify this statistical relationship. Many types of regression are adopted in scientific research, depending on the feature and type of given data.

The most used model for conduction regression is called the linear regression model, which is used when the distribution of the response variable Y  is continuous and approximately regular. Linear regression is the procedure that estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, with at least one independent variable that best predicts the value of a dependent variable. Our goal is to predict the outcome Y based on the given values of predictor variables Xi . The linear regression model allows us to evaluate the impact of multiple variables in the same model.
